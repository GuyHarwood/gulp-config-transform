# gulp-config-transform
A gulp plugin to apply `web.config` transforms. You can use this plugin for using gulp with Visual Studio solutions to produce various configurations. This is especially useful when upgrading legacy web applications to ASP.NET 5 since the `web.config` isn't natively supported.
